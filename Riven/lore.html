      <div class="text">
        Built on perpetual conflict, Noxus has never had a shortage of war orphans. Her father lost to an unnamed battle and her mother to the girl’s own stubborn birth, Riven was raised on a farm run by the empire on the rocky hillsides of Trevale.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Physical strength and ferocious will kept the children alive and working on the hard scrap of land, but Riven hungered for more than simply bread on the table. She watched conscriptors from regional warbands visiting the farms, year after year, and in them, she saw a chance at the life she dreamed of. When she finally pledged the empire her strength, she knew Noxus would embrace her as the daughter she longed to be.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Riven proved a natural soldier. Young as she was, her years of hard labor allowed her to quickly master the weight of a longsword taller than herself. Her new family was forged in the heat of battle, and Riven saw her bond to her brothers- and sisters-in-arms as unbreakable.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        So exceptional was her dedication to the empire, that Boram Darkwill himself recognized her with a runic blade of dark metal, enchanted by a pale sorceress within his court. The weapon was heavier than a kite shield and nearly as broad—perfectly suited to Riven’s tastes.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Not long after, the warhosts set sail for Ionia as part of the long-planned Noxian invasion.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        As this new war dragged on, it became clear that Ionia would not kneel. Riven’s unit was assigned to escort another warband making its way through the embattled province of Navori. The warband’s leader, Emystan, had employed a Zaunite alchymist, eager to test a new kind of weapon. Across countless campaigns, Riven would gladly have given her life for Noxus, but now she saw something awry in these other soldiers—something that made her deeply uncomfortable. The fragile amphorae they carried on their wagons had no purpose on any battlefield she could imagine...
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        The two warbands met increasingly fierce resistance, as if even the land itself sought to defy them. During a heavy rain storm, with mud pouring down the hillsides, Riven and her warriors were stranded with their deadly cargo—and it was then that the Ionian fighters revealed themselves. Seeing the danger, Riven called to Emystan for support.
      </div>

      <div class="img1"></div>
      <div class="h1">Riven the Exile</div>
    
      <div class="text">
        The only answer she received was a flaming arrow, fired out from the ridgeline, and Riven understood this was no longer a war to expand the borders of Noxus. It was to be a complete annihilation of the enemy, no matter the cost.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        The wagon was hit straight on. Instinctively, Riven drew her sword, but it was too late to protect anyone but herself. Chemical fire burst from the ruptured containers, and screams filled the night—both Ionian and Noxian falling victim to an agonizing, gruesome death. Shielded from the scorching, poisonous mists by the magic of her blade, she bore unwilling witness to scenes of horror and betrayal that would haunt her forever.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        For Riven, memories of the hours that followed come only in fragments, and nightmares. She bound her wounds. She mourned the dead. But, most of all, she came to hate the sword that saved her life. The words carved into its surface mocked her, reminding her of all she had lost. She would find a way to break it, severing her last tie to Noxus, before the dawn.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        But when the blade was finally shattered, still she found no peace.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Stripped of the faith and conviction that had bolstered her entire life, Riven chose to exile herself, wandering Ionia’s battle-scarred landscape. When she finally returned to the village where she had broken the sword, it was revealed that her self-destructive needs had cost the life of their most revered elder... and yet Ionia embraced her with forgiveness.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Noxus was not nearly so merciful. Although the empire had long since withdrawn from the First Lands, it had not forgotten about Riven, or her runic blade. After fighting fiercely against those sent to bring her to justice, she refused to let any more Ionian blood be shed on her account, and surrendered herself to the charges of desertion leveled against her.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        As she returns to Noxus in chains, Riven remains haunted. Though Darkwill is no more, and the empire is rumored to have evolved, she is uncertain what will become of her, or whether she will ever be made whole again.
      </div>
      <div class="img2"></div>
      <div class="h">Story</div>

      <div class="text">
        “How came you to Ionia, friend?”
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Muramaat tried to keep her voice light. She had never felt uncomfortable sharing a campfire with other travelers along the road to the markets before. This, however, marked her first time sitting across the flames from a Noxian, one with an enormous weapon sheathed across her back.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        How many Ionian lives has that blade claimed? she wondered.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        The white-haired woman glanced at her “father” before swallowing a mouthful of charred peppers and rice, then cast her eyes down at her plate. “I was born in Noxus,” she said, her accent thick but her tonality nearly flawless. “I have not been back since the war, and I do not plan to return.”
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        The Noxian’s father, Asa Konte, smiled and placed his hand on her shoulder. “This is her home now,” he said with finality.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Muramaat had invited Asa to make camp with her before she had spotted the Noxian asleep in the back of his cart. He had introduced her as his daughter, Riven, in this same tone, with his chin jutting forward in preemptive defense. Muramaat hadn’t pushed back against the strange old man’s declaration then, but that didn’t mean his “daughter” was beyond scrutiny.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        “You have not answered my question,” Muramaat pressed, the chimes of her mender’s necklace clinking together as she poured herself a cup of tea. “What brought you to our shores, Riven?”
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Riven tightly gripped her plate, tension rippling through her shoulders. “I fought in the war.”
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        A simple statement, laden with sorrow. Curious, to hear regret from a Noxian.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        “Why did you stay?” Muramaat asked. “Why would anyone stay in a place where they and their people have caused so much pain, so much destruction?”
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Crack.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        The plate had broken in half in Riven’s white-knuckled grip, her charred peppers and rice falling to the ground. With a gasp, she dropped the plate shards before bowing ruefully. “My deepest apologies,” she mumbled as she rose. “I will pay for this plate, and then we will leave you to your evening. I didn’t mean to intrude—”
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        But Muramaat wasn’t listening. Instead, she cradled the broken plate in her hands and held the shards to her ear, humming softly. Slowly, she adjusted her pitch, calling to the spirit within the clay.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        The back of her skull tingled when she hit the right tone, as the spirit reverberated with her hum. Holding the note, Muramaat lifted her necklace and flicked its chimes until she found the one that joined her and the spirit in song.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        She stared at the chime in the firelight—each one had been inscribed with a symbol that identified how to mend a resonant spirit. This symbol was for smoke, a single line with a curve that became more pronounced toward the end. Muramaat lifted the shards above the fire to bathe them in the smoke. It took only moments before they knitted back together, with only a few coal-colored seams and ridges to show that the plate had ever been broken.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        “I’m a mender,” she said as she held the pottery out to a wide-eyed Riven. “No need to replace anything.”
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Riven took the plate and examined it. “How does it work?” she asked, running a finger down a thick black seam.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        “Everything has a spirit, and every spirit wants to be whole. I ask them what they need to mend, and give it to them.”
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        “It leaves scars,” Riven sighed.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        “Scars are a sign of healing. That plate will never be seamless again, but it is whole. And it is strong. I’d even say it is more beautiful like this.”
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Riven considered the plate in silence.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        “I am still here,” she said after a moment, “because I have caused so much pain and so much destruction. I stay to atone.”
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Muramaat nodded somberly. Clearly Riven’s scars, though invisible, ran deep. Perhaps this Noxian was different from the others.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        But then Muramaat’s eyes fell to the hilt of Riven’s massive weapon. A tool for cutting, not mending.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        How different can she really be?
      </div>

      <div class="img3"></div>
      <div class="h1">Seams and Scars</div>

      <div class="text">
        Muramaat woke bleary-eyed to a loud thump against the side of her caravan. Bandits. Riven had insisted on keeping watch through the night, Muramaat remembered as she grabbed her heaviest kettle. But the mender was experienced in dealing with robbers and could always hold her own in a fight.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        When she opened her door, however, she saw that Riven would not need her help after all.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        One of the intruders lay crumpled at the foot of the caravan. By the fire stood Riven, surrounded by three hulking bandits. She held the enormous hilt, and Muramaat was surprised to see only a broken blade attached to the end. Yet the weapon was still formidable. It seemed to pulse in Riven’s hands as she waited for the others to advance.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Muramaat’s stomach turned to see that blade, not relishing the sight of a Noxian spilling more Ionian blood... but still she watched.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        The bandits rushed at Riven, yelling incoherently, but she took a single step forward and repulsed them with a burst of energy from her blade. They dropped their weapons, then scrambled to find them in the dark. Riven could have cut them all down, Muramaat realized, but she didn’t. Instead, she raised her sword, which began to glow an eerie green. The magic from the weapon blasted outward and repelled one of the bandits as soon as it touched him. He fell to the ground in a catatonic daze.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        By this point, the others were on their feet, weapons in hand. Riven brought her arm back, and glowing pieces of metal raced toward the Noxian from the cart. The shards formed around the blade, making it look almost whole—though there were still gaps between the pieces. The bandits rushed her again.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Or so they tried. Riven whipped the blade in front of her and blew them back against the caravan with a sudden gust of wind, knocking them all unconscious.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        A bloodless victory.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Muramaat stepped gingerly over the defeated bandits. “What will you do with them?” she asked Riven, who had barely broken a sweat.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Riven shrugged, letting the shards of her sword drop to the ground. “I’ll just tie them to a tree until morning.”
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Muramaat stared at the remnant of the blade. It didn’t seem as threatening anymore, now that she had seen how Riven wielded it. “Could I see your weapon?”
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Riven frowned and took a step back. “Why?”
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        “You don’t need to hand it to me. Just hold it up.”
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Warily, Riven raised the blade. Muramaat closed her eyes and hummed.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        “What are you doing?” Riven asked in alarm, just as Muramaat found the right pitch—
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        —a pair of eyes, searching—
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        —three hunters, hearts filled with hate, thoughts with revenge— 
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        —burning—
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        —everything, burning—
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Muramaat didn’t realize she had fallen until she felt Riven shake her. “Are you all right?”
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        “Someone,” Muramaat whispered, her throat dry, “is searching for this blade. For you.”
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Riven blanched, but her eyes revealed nothing of her thoughts. “What did you do, Muramaat?” she asked in a low whisper.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        “I was wrong to question you. I wanted to offer my apologies by mending your sword.”
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        “No.” The intensity of the word took Muramaat by surprise. “If you truly want to thank me, you will never fix this blade.” Riven chuckled, a bitter sound. “The one thing I would want you to fix, you can’t. But... thank you. For the offer.”
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        She sighed, exhausted, and collected up the shards of her sword.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        “You should go back to sleep if you want to get to the marketplace early tomorrow.”
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Muramaat nodded and slowly made her way to her caravan. When she looked back, Riven was at the fire, sitting and watching the night.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Not for the first time, Muramaat wished she knew how to mend people.
